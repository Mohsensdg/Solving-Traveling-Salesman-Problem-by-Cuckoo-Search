# Solving-Traveling-Salesman-Problem-by-Cuckoo-Search
A modified cuckoo search algorithm was developed to solve the Traveling Salesman Problem (TSP).
It is a test code to verify the cuckoo search algorithm on TSP. It was a part of my Master's thesis which I did in 2018.
My thesis concerened solving Transit Network Design Problem (an NP hard problem). I deployed CS to solve TNDP for the first time. At the early stage of verifying CS I solved TSP by a modified version of CS in Matlab.
